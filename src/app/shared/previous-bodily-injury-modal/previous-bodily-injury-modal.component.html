        We need to know the amount of Bodily Injury (BI) coverage you previously held.
    </p>
    <p>
        BI coverage is shown as two amounts — like $250k/$500k — which is the per-person maximum / per-accident maximum
        payout.

        This info can be found on the coverage overview page you recieved from your insurance company.
